(********************************************************************
   Market Maker

   The Market Maker module holds information about the MM's previous
   bid asks spreads.  It also includes getters and setters and
   basic statistics.  For more statistics, we draw from the statistics module.

   takes in a new [bid] and [ask] price set by the player and the current 
   [market] of type t.
