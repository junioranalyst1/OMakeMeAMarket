  *     In implementaiton 1, the cheat command currently compares previous 
  *     bid/asks and uses a linear regression model to suggest the next move, 
  *     referencing the actual value.
  *
  *     In implementation II, the cheat command factors in a least-squares 
  *    regression model to predict your next move.  It compares this to
  *    the actual value of the dice roll.  Based off of your previous ask/bids
  *    we apply a Gaussian blur matrix to this to find another average value.
  *    We then use Chebyschev's inequality and the variance of your previous
  *    moves to appropriately offset this second average from the expected 
  *    rolls.  Finally, we incorporate the first average, subtract the two
  *    and present that as a good guess for the next move.  
  *    This is essentially the procedure a market maker would use to price 
  *    the next bid/ask spread.
